# Coffee_Shop-Project
This is a side project extracting Coffee Shops information from CSV and Shapefile using basic PostGreSQL and PostGIS.\
\
The Coffee Shops SQL.md file contains some basic PostGreSQL working with Cambridge_coffee_shops database and Cambridge Neighborhood information. I couldn't find the R file in which I wrote the pricing analysis part :slightly_frowning_face:.\
\
The SQL Bootcamp Project.md file contains some queries from the SQL Bootcamp.\
\
I wanted to attch some queries I wrote when doing the Median/Hard questions on Leetcode and HackerRank, but there would be way too many questions that I want to include :joy:.\
\
Again, I would like to express my strong interest in _**joining**_ your organization, _**learning**_ from the team members, _**developing**_ my skills, _**gaining**_ knowledge and experience, and _**making positive contributions to the team!**_
